An organizational tool that tracks insurance and personal payments. The sales rep knows exactly how much money has been paid out to their customer and how much is left to collect. When juggling 50-100 projects a season, thats hundreds of checks to keep track of. Why not have an app do that for you?

This is the original version of Roof Tracker that uses CoreData as the database infrastructure.


This app is for insurance proceeds roofing sales reps to keep track of the money paid/owed to the insured and contractor. This app will provide simple and informative answers to:


1. Has the insurance company paid all money for the claim including supplements and actual cash value (ACV) for work not done by the contractor?

2. What is the invoice amount due including any cash jobs and outstanding ACV as payments come in?


Furthermore, the app features a single-page summary report to be sent to your supplement team detailing what money has not been paid to the insured and why.


HOW TO USE:

Create a file by tapping the "+" icon in the top right corner.
Add the details, set a picture, then let the Roof Tracker do the heavy lifting (all those irritating calculations)!
